    "We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.\n",

    "Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:\n",

    "If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.\n",
